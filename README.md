# ChatCLI.js-client
Command line chat client built with socket.io. ChatCLI.js is what your mom warned you about!
# Installation
**Make sure you have NodeJS installed.**  
You will need an ChatCLI.js server. Get it from [here](https://github.com/m-Phoenix852/ChatCLI.js-server/).   
**Note that this CLI completely depends on a ChatCLI.js server, you will definitely need one**
Open config.js, everything is mentioned there. Do the configurations, and then run `node .` or `npm start` in the directory and boom you are connected to the ChatCLI.js server, invite more users by sharing this client and the server URL.
